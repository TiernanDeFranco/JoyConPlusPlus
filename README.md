# JoyCon++

An open-source C++ library for interfacing with Nintendo Switch Joy-Con controllers (Joy-Con 1 and Joy-Con 2) on Windows.

---

## Overview üéÆ

**JoyCon++** provides a foundation for developers and researchers interested in low-level interaction with Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons, supporting both Bluetooth Classic (Joy-Con 1) and Bluetooth Low Energy (Joy-Con 2).

- **Joy-Con 1** devices require manual Bluetooth pairing to appear as HID devices on Windows. Although full Joy-Con 1 support isn‚Äôt the initial focus of the first commit, it is supported through the `JoyCon` class in `joycon.cpp`. This class can be instantiated by passing the vendor ID, product ID, and serial number obtained from HID enumeration, enabling direct reading and writing of input reports. Implementing Joy-Con 1 functionality is straightforward with this approach.

- **Joy-Con 2** devices broadcast BLE advertisements when the sync button is held. JoyCon++ scans for these advertisements, allowing users to select and connect to a device and subscribe to the correct BLE characteristics. However, input notifications from Joy-Con 2 have not been successfully received yet despite subscribing, making this the current main focus for further development and experimentation.

## Current Functionality

- Scans for Joy-Con 1 devices via HID enumeration (requires manual pairing beforehand).
- Scans and detects Joy-Con 2 devices broadcasting BLE advertisements during sync mode.
- Enables connecting and subscribing to BLE characteristics on Joy-Con 2.
- Includes a `JoyCon` class for Joy-Con 1 input report handling (not fully integrated yet).

## Intended Use and Design

The goal is to provide an open framework for anyone interested in exploring, decoding, or building on Joy-Con input data. JoyCon++ is primarily a developer tool and research project rather than a finished user-facing product.

- Each Joy-Con is treated as an individual device with its own inputs and sensors.
- The library does **not** combine inputs or provide shared controls out of the box.
- This approach allows developers to build custom logic for combining or processing multiple controllers however they see fit.
- The library supports connecting multiple Joy-Cons independently, which is useful for advanced use cases (e.g., motion-controlled games using several controllers per player, requiring seperate gyro and accelerometer values).

## Quirks and Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- For **Joy-Con 1 (HID)**, ensure the device is fully paired and connected before scanning. The Joy-Con light should be solid, otherwise the device won't appear in HID enumeration.
- For **Joy-Con 2 (BLE)**, devices show up when broadcasting advertisements such as when pressing buttons, but you must hold the sync button for pairing mode before connecting and subscribing.
- The `joycon.cpp` file is included to assist with Joy-Con 1 input decoding and may be useful for Joy-Con 2 research, but it was not the focus of the initial implementation.
- Full Joy-Con 1 support through HID input reading is possible with the current codebase but requires additional integration work.

## Dependencies and Environment

- Tested on Windows 10 64-bit with Visual Studio.
- Relies on Windows Runtime APIs and HIDAPI.
- No external package manager required but developers may need to ensure Windows SDK and appropriate runtime components are installed.

## Contributing ü§ù

- Experiment freely with the code and your own implementations.
- Document what works and what doesn‚Äôt.
- This project focuses on building a foundation to decode and handle Joy-Con 2 inputs; Joy-Con 1 support is secondary but present.
- Raise issues or pull requests on GitHub to share your findings or improvements.
- Open to collaboration for completing and improving this library.

## Summary

JoyCon++ is an experimental and open toolset for working with Joy-Con controllers on Windows at a low level, aimed at developers and hobbyists interested in custom input handling, research, and new ways of interfacing with these devices.
